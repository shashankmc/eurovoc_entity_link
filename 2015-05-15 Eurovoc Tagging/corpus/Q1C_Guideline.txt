GENERAL The ICH harmonised Tripartite Guideline on Stability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products was issued on October 27, 1993. This document is an annex to the ICH parent stability guideline and addresses the recommendations 
on what should be submitted regarding stability of new dosage forms by the 
owner of the original application, after the original submission for new drug substances and products.  2. NEW DOSAGE FORMS A new dosage form is defined as a drug product which is a different pharmaceutical product type, but contains the same active substance as included in the existing drug product approved by the pertinent regulatory authority.  Such pharmaceutical product types include products of different administration route (e.g., oral to parenteral), new specific functionality/delivery systems  (e.g., immediate release tablet to modified release tablet) and different dosage 
forms of the same administration route (e.g., capsule to tablet, solution to 
suspension).  Stability protocols for new dosage forms should follow the guidance in the parent stability guideline in principle. However, a reduced stability database at submission time (e.g., 6 months accelerated and 6 months long term data from 
ongoing studies) may be acceptable in certain justified cases.   1
